ScriptRunner - an electron app for running configured scripts from the menu bar

BUILD:
    Clone the repo (duh..)
    Run the following in a terminal:
        `npm run build:mac`   (For macOs)
        `npm run build:win`   (For Win)
        `npm run build:linux` (For Linux)
        `npm run build`       (For all)

USAGE:
    Compressed (.zip) distributions are provided in /bin for direct usage.
    Unzip the appropriate distribution or build manually as above.

    Run executables from appropriate folder:
        bin/ScriptRunner-darwin-x64     (For macOs)
        bin/ScriptRunner-win32-x64      (For Win)
        bin/ScriptRunner-linux-x64      (For Linux)

SETTINGS:
    The Settings menu item opens the settings file.. It should be of the following format..
    {
        "scripts": [
            // add one object (like below) per script 
            {
                // used in menu item as `Run <label>`
                "label": "myScript",

                // absolute path of the executable
                "file": "path/to/script>",
                
                // (optional) timeout in ms (default is 1000)
                "timeout": 5000
            }
        ]
    }

COMMON ERRORS:
    `Permission Denied`: The script files provided need to be executable.. (chmod +x <script.sh>)
    `File not found`: The script file wasn't found on the path given.. (Check spelling)

EXAMPLE:
    Let's say you have a vpn installed that requires you to run setup and teardown commands in terminal.
    Assuming the commands are `vpn start` and `vpn stop` respectively.
    To be able to run these from the menu bar, follow the steps below:

        Create file `vpn_start_script.sh` with `vpn start` as contents
        Run the following in terminal: `chmod +x path/to/vpn_start_script.sh`
        Run ScriptRunner. It should show the app icon in the menubar (top bar).
        Click on the app icon in the menubar. It should show a dropdown (context menu) with Settings as an option.
        Click on Settings option. It should open settings.json (in user's app data directory).
        Add `{"label": "Vpn Start", "file": "path/to/vpn_start_script.sh"}` (as described in SETTINGS section)
        Save the file. The menu bar app dropdown will now show `Run Vpn Start` option.
        Click on the `Run Vpn Start` option and the vpn is started..!!

    You can do the same for `vpn stop` command and have `Run Vpn Stop` option in the app dropdown.
    Note that once added these options are persistent and don't go away even if you quit the app.

    Tip: If you want these scripts available all the time, add the application to your startup programs.
    This will run the app whenever the system starts
